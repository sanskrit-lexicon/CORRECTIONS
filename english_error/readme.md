# sanskrit_dict.txt

1. It is a mixture of headwords of sanhw1.txt in SLP1 and itrans transliteration.
2. known_words_not_in_enchant.txt have been manually added to it.
3. For Wilson, we needed a list of botanical names, because it is giving a lot of false positives. wil_latin.txt was extracted from wil and added in the word list to avoid false positives in future.
