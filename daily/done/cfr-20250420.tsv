The form: " ddaṣadi" in every single occurrence can only be this: " dṛṣadi" – There is no other possible correct combination of these letters.	srhodes@snowcrest.net

Apte Dictionary gives: "ardhacandrākṛti" ; while MW gives "ardhacandrākṛta". The question for Andhrabharati is this: "Are both forms correct?" OR is one of the two forms incorrect?	srhodes@snowcrest.net
