dict=AP, L=5073, hw=avantiḥ, user=srhodes
old = suddaśo
new = sudṛśo
comment = Typo – You may consider to make this a Global Correction using the target search: " suddaś"  ——becomes—–  " sudṛś" • the initial space surrounding the target search " suddaś" is required to avoid ativyāpti, which I am sure will delight Andhrabharati, by my mention. The form: " suddaś" in every single occurrence can only be this: " sudṛś" – There is no other possible correct combination of these letters.

comment = Typo – Please note that I prefer this correction that gives the correct transliteration. The important point here is that the letter: "ch" is misleading, because the correct letter is: "c".
