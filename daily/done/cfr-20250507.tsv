05/07/2025 14:05:22	AP	5012	avadhiḥ	 ddaṣṭa	 ddaṣṭa	Typo – You may consider to make this a Global Correction using the target search: " ddaṣṭ"  ——becomes—–  " dṛṣṭ" • the initial space surrounding the target search " ddaṣṭ" is required to avoid ativyāpti, which I am sure will delight Andhrabharati, by my mention. The form: " ddaṣṭ" in every single occurrence can only be this: " dṛṣṭ" – There is no other possible correct combination of these letters.	srhodes@snowcrest.net
