05/08/2025 14:26:21	AP	5073	avantiḥ	suddaśo	sudṛśo	Typo – You may consider to make this a Global Correction using the target search: " suddaś"  ——becomes—–  " sudṛś" • the initial space surrounding the target search " suddaś" is required to avoid ativyāpti, which I am sure will delight Andhrabharati, by my mention. The form: " suddaś" in every single occurrence can only be this: " sudṛś" – There is no other possible correct combination of these letters.	srhodes@snowcrest.net
