Typo – Please note that this is a suggested "print change", following MW dictionary and the following reasoning: "dhūma" is masculine in gender. Here we have substantive that simply is "thick smoke". If something "has thick smoke", then THAT is another matter. But for jiust "thick smoke" itself (as cited here), the gender should be stated as masculine.	srhodes@snowcrest.net
