Since the Window Display is identical in both cases, there is no point in listing this Headword a second time. It is important to note that this Headword is only printed a single time in Devanāgarī script. Therefore, it must appear only once in the Hierarchy Alphabetical Display List. MW, APTE and Shabda seem to agree.	Headword Listed Twice	srhodes@snowcrest.net

04/30/2025 15:35:03	AP	4791	avakīrṇa	ddaṣṭvā	dṛṣṭvā	Typo – You may consider to make this a Global Correction using the target search: " ddaṣṭ"  ——becomes—–  " dṛṣṭ" • the initial space surrounding the target search " ddaṣṭ" is required to avoid ativyāpti, which I am sure will delight Andhrabharati, by my mention. The form: " ddaṣṭ" in every single occurrence can only be this: " dṛṣṭ" – There is no other possible correct combination of these letters.	srhodes@snowcrest.net
