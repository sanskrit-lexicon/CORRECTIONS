04/23/2025 08:05:01	LRV	3441	arthya	Headword Listed Twice	Please DELETE the second redundant listing of this Headword in the Hierarchy. Since the Window Display is identical in both cases, there is no point in listing this Headword a second time. It is important to note that this Headword is only printed a single time in Devanāgarī script. Therefore, it must appear only once in the Hierarchy Alphabetical Display List. MW, APTE and Shabda seem to agree.	Headword Listed Twice	srhodes@snowcrest.net
