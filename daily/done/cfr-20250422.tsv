04/22/2025 17:23:24	AP	4590	arpita	kuddhaḥ	kruddhaḥ	Typo – You may consider to make this a Global Correction using the target search: " kuddhaḥ"  ——becomes—–  " kruddhaḥ" • the initial space surrounding the target search " kuddhaḥ" is required to avoid ativyāpti, which I am sure will delight Andhrabharati, by my mention. The form: " kuddhaḥ" in every single occurrence can only be this: " kruddhaḥ" – There is no other possible correct combination of these letters.	srhodes@snowcrest.net
