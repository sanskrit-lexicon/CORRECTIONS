old = cf. vi-;
new = DELETE ?
comment = Typo – Please note that I am unable to trace the reference made above: "cf. vi-". I hope that Andhrabharati will look into this. I find no such form as: "vitṛh" etc.

Case 3: 04/30/2025 08:28:16
dict=LRV, L=3531, hw=arha, user=srhodes
old = Headword Listed Twice
new = Please DELETE the second redundant listing of this Headword in the Hierarchy. Since the Window Display is identical in both cases, there is no point in listing this Headword a second time. It is important to note that this Headword is only printed a single time in Devanāgarī script. Therefore, it must appear only once in the Hierarchy Alphabetical Display List. MW, APTE and Shabda seem to agree.

Case 6: 04/30/2025 15:35:03
dict=AP, L=4791, hw=avakīrṇa, user=srhodes
old = ddaṣṭvā
new = dṛṣṭvā
comment = Typo – You may consider to make this a Global Correction using the target search: " ddaṣṭ"  ——becomes—–  " dṛṣṭ" • the initial space surrounding the target search " ddaṣṭ" is required to avoid ativyāpti, which I am sure will delight Andhrabharati, by my mention. The form: " ddaṣṭ" in every single occurrence can only be this: " dṛṣṭ" – There is no other possible correct combination of these letters.

comment = Typo – Please note that the "hyphen" is generally not used, according to the current standard. And, even if some consider it optional, why waste the space, when Sanskrit prides itself on brevity.
